# App-controlled drone
This is a school project that we decided to make. This contain the android app, server and a client that's on the drone.
In this project you'll need [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed.

To get started on the server and drone client download the repository and go to [server_client](https://github.com/KTheXIII/app-controlled-drone/tree/master/server_client) map to read the README for further instruction.

You can find the android app [here](https://github.com/Chasarr/DronePack).

Note, this project is meant to be use for testing only.
